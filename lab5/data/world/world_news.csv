[brazilian president-elect luiz inácio da silva] lula’s second term, followed him. saw paraguay decades ago, decade ago now. saw attempt united states america, months ago, january, year ago. there’s deeper questions got analyze it’s bring individual power. kind cabinet brought? reflective direction vote president? reflection provincial elements country, where, case soon brazil, inauguration lula

vote particularly class, promising speak welfare majority marginalized oppressed citizens, particularly indigenous citizens case peru, we’ve got standing organized citizens’ movement 24/7 reinforces people’s power, happens government structures. so, general kinds propositions. i’m trying to… trying read learn particular case peru, we’ve seen similar events arenas think anticipate bourgeois corporate class-oriented try overturn popular vote popular parliamentary procedures. jacqueline luqman: know, mr. early, think find curious situation peru left-wing parties abandoned castillo also, decreed temporary dissolution congress, kind thing prompted this, called fresh parliamentarian elections months, installed emergency government rule country legislative powers renewed. called

months relationship left parties pedro castillo outstanding questions think examine. sean blackmon: definitely. know, you’re right, mr. early, talk we’ve seen sort thing before, definitely latin

obscure certain dynamics well. hoping that, too. james early: well, pink tide juxtaposed notion red tide. red tide socialist, slash communist ideological outlook immediate intent transformation owns modes production, socialize important life-defining elements like food shelter, education, health, sure people access that, limiting private enterprise. instances, people tried abandon it. instances, we’ve seen vietnam, we’re seeing, cuba adjust, limited space private initiative gorge public, takes away public well-being. pink tide sort interim, social, democratic policies. formal ideological

questioned struggle things u.s. bipartisan system, democrats republicans, we’ve seen, passed huge military budget adding 45 billion dollars requested. so, these, again, complexities think got able talk about, engage everyday citizens active making kinds analysis able negotiate contradictions emerge. sean blackmon: definitely. we’re gonna break hour note “by means necessary” radio sputnik washington, d.c. we’ll right back. stay means necessary. jacquie luqman continue joined mr. james early. know, mr. early, thinking break, because, know, appreciate know, you’re keen remind know, democracy collective process sustained collective process shouldn’t fall trap celebrity rising individual leaders. thinking u.s. context, particularly issue moore v. harper. case continues relevant u.s., continue hold that, know, far right attempt basically people’s fundamental democratic rights case, basically, issue person, vote itself, seemingly stake, extent, lot response fight democrats liberal wing ruling class. we’re looking situation where, know, far right gets way, threat basically like permanent, like right wing government united states, different bodies ability kind power vote place. i’m wondering sort conceive kind democratic project place like united states, fundamentally undemocratic nature, root know, time, that, know, beginning, purposeful effort ensure that, know, real participatory democracy governed united states, instead, basically whims wealthy minority, rule. know, this, somewhat speculative, it’s certainly moment we’re right now. kinds principles useful relevant begin think seriously new kind society, new system west. james early: think start concluded, open broad consistent public debate, again, public education discourse fact democracy exist describes officially united states. person vote calculus delivers stewardship local, state federal level. electoral college, fundamentally racist, historical contemporary tool. dominant duopoly two-party system republicans democrats. they’re special electorate individuals’ status inhabit governance structure, votes outweigh popular will. resulting paralyzed, dysfunctional federal system particular, fights basketball football game team win. question policies win, right wing so-called … liberals, holding status quo. joe biden clear “return normal order.” turn [msnbc host] joe scarborough, msnbc, cnn, nbc, abc stations, see, traditional liberal democratic pundit sitting moderate… called moderate republicans left party thrown party, band try reestablish duopoly dominance parties compete stewardship government, perennially local, state federal level. effect, dictatorship duopoly, it’s like party wings, will, fight oust democratic… social democratic policymakers certainly fight valid democratic socialist. so, case republican move, right establish effect record one-party governance mechanism regard, formally, popular will. right now, democrats argue can’t republicans stand way. republicans basic line let’s rid democrats, they’re socialists communists. so, tragedy comedy goes on. popular will, thought it’s it’s recognized, life circumstances continue deteriorate. resurgence covid, and, course, know reveal again, vulnerable people black brown women, working class, lgbtq, running class race line, lgbt category, trade union line going… running race gender, horizontal profile trade unions, thing. question democracy, discourse goes “we protect u.s. democratic system.” important protect rights freedom facilitation people express will, let deceive continue deceive responded content democracy. is, policy issues peoplecan work improve lives protect lives, reach legitimate dream? that’s content democracy question discussed. discussed we’re diverted pro forma situation we’re protecting ultimately precious, ultimately precious sense deliver historically marginalized, oppressed exploited people, including class sectors white community, reasons delusion skin color, socialized, outright hatred, biologically inbred, socialized educated, mis educated we’re seeing what’s going school systems turned away obvious underpinnings history uphold structure continues immiserate amphetamine addictions running country, sign people un-rooted, people lives unstable. so, question nature democracy addition fighting new maneuver republicans, let democrats stalwart protection philosophical abstraction continued paralyzed practical elements delivering. can’t… look situation california… [former u.s. representative california’s 37th district los angeles mayor] karen bass declaring state emergency… los angeles recently. unbelievable. walk downtown areas los angeles, sort human infestation will, people living sidewalk camps, know, block block block. got monumental state buildings, glowing towers so-called development. contrast right there. democracy, public policies delivered. so, think approach this, holding democrats accountable. stalwarts protect republican surge, organized citizens demanding democracy delivered content. let stop point: petition democratic party; organized citizens, identifying, maturing, nurturing, voting stewards governance accountable them, hold accountable. right now, professional politicians, we, people, demos, ordinary people [unintelligible] power ordinary people sidelined voting going boxing match something. jacqueline luqman: know, mr. early, people respond said about, know, needing hold democrats accountable don’t legislatively? people telling, vote save evil republicans? people respond saying, “well, look, people like [u.s. representative georgia’s 14th district] marjorie taylor greene congress, saying things like, organized january 6, won,” meaning, know, trump errs won, gotten wanted. point to, know, republican extremists, extremists gop, trump errs gop, that’s gop now, proof problem democrats, need focus democrats, need guys. james early: here’s issue. we’re talking question power. politics, mean, power, power improve one’s lives, protect slice, envision new possibilities, allot public resources, projects collaboration everyday citizens that. parties deliver us, tactical difference, raised level strategy common upholding system, there, spaces recognize. is, certain policies people able push citizens able push for, way comes it’s propagated individual congresswoman, congressperson it, organized citizens use example democratic socialists recently, [u.s. senator representing vermont twice ran u.s. president] bernie sanders. bernie sanders build movement, intersected organized movements. nurses, trade unions, there. we’ve seen new developments, like working families party like, existing organized citizens movements fighting sectoral areas, areas women’s rights, lgbt rights, anti-racism, right health rights. draw horizontal line, node node, network network build integrated force, reflected new party. initially, it’s reflected citizens looking right left saying, “yes, share objectives, i’m focused particular sector.” identify people vote stewards governance, 340 odd million people divided half, look half voters voting right wing stuff reasons, half relatively progressive arenas. run country individuals, need apparatus, state apparatus, need capable stewards governance that. so, folks fight, describe fight. yes, democratic party ally. battle republican party, find spaces governance structure, force agenda things help improve lives strengthen ability point, “trump,” will, transition duopoly parties set interests masses ordinary citizens. sean blackmon: definitely, definitely. know, sort sticking idea building radical popular democracy, participatory democracy, we’ve seen built… develop world, specifically parts latin america different ways. recently venezuela marked, it’s day loyalty love [former venezuelan president] hugo chavez. course, chavez was, know, beloved admired leader, stress collective nature democracy specific context venezuela’s bolivarian revolution, emphasized importance communes. i’m wondering sort playing venezuelan context? situate like hugo chavez, individual existed way efforts support masses countrymen? james early: well, have, recent occasions program, programs done, steered people emphasizing importance social movements, social organization, trade unions sector, specific groups, uniting another. don’t want dismiss role individual role individual history certainly current circumstances, different instances important. role individual runs spectrum far right left, mussolini hitler extraordinarily powerful, compelling individuals public space convince people horrendous things we’ve seen human history, holocaust issues, others. case [former south african president nelson] mandela confused case [former cuban president] fidel castro. see… [former indian prime minister] indira gandhi… again, role strong individuals relationship organize movements. therein, setting people power, governance kinds situations communes others. think it’s important principle, here’s problem we’re wanting do: level scale. government resources, government expertise build level scale. objective contradictions faced, including hugo chavez face. venezuela sits largest oil resources far know world. hugo chavez, extraordinary things building regional institutions like [union south american nations] unasur, community latin american caribbean nations, production massive numbers doctors fidel castro sent latin american medical school (elam) [santiago de] los banos outside havana cuba oil! evidence oil sold $100 barrel more, little evidence surplus putting large scale solar. so, find tethered extractive industries. case [former bolivian president] evo morales, and… help bolivia, bolivia, countries, here’s native american president socialist, socialist party, governance structure survive … individual survive coup, inherit state. immediate contradictions ran progressive indigenous population maintaining extractive industries. difficult questions, they’re easily ideologically say, “let’s mode production else.” practical arena, complex difficult. so, i’ve heard lot know, local development foodstuff, communities, providing wholesome food detroit oakland areas. important developments signal future go. able collective resources generally reside local, state federal state budget. levels scale involve many, people. case venezuela. now, there’s big interesting think important debate goes communist party venezuela relationship [venezuelan president nicolas] maduro socialist party, set late president hugo chavez, arguing issues workers treated, commands developed. yes, direction, level scale people’s power institutionalized it’s aspect ideological, romantic kind view implementation. sean blackmon: definitely we’re gonna quick break note “by means necessary” radio sputnik, washington, d.c., we’ll right back, stay us. sean blackmon: mr. early. looking reports conversations ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy having different governments, namely, united states president joe biden, emmanuel macron france recep erdoğan turkey, course. now, they’ve been, know, contact before, reportedly, latest slew conversations taken place single day. quoted saying “we constantly working partners…” added expects “important results coming week” number events do, course, ongoing war ukraine. now, it’s clear means, substance meetings were. but, mean, we’ve reached point ukraine conflict things continue escalate. time goes on, dangerous situation countries involved, world. mean, i’m sure people remember couple weeks ago missiles struck poland killing people. asserted platforms mainstream media zelenskyy himself, were, fact, russian missiles, ukrainian government officials joe biden basically pointed wasn’t clear origins missiles yet. i’m i’m wondering you’re considering conflict point, don’t think overstated, dangerous potential open conflict nuclear powers united states russia. mean, it’s somewhat relief, know people biden administration advocating negotiations. ultimately happen, think, remains seen, wondering you’re considering it? james early: well, think witnessing western europe united states australia japan, lot marbles table ukraine, argue vantage point wouldn’t fight argue stalemate, want argue ukraine winning. let’s assume sake argument ukraine winning, cost? totally destroyed country balkanized russian-speaking populations, way impose governance populations recognize element national minority rights, countries aligned politically[?], believes referendum tied russia, crimea. things we’re beginning hear people west say, well, there’s going negotiated settlement bring closer nuclear conflict. time playing game chicken poland, example, sitting right russian border, military, u.s. military bases going there’s game chicken played. there’s bigger circle political global engagement that’s going want attention dating formally…now obama administration, turning eyes pacific, means china. they’re going rabbit hole, you’re paying billions billions dollars exhausting military hardware, united states western europe, putting ukraine, seeing winter come seeing fluctuation oil prices, don’t know what’s going happen cap russian oil. watching debate, price oil dropped. lot machinations table. they’ve concentrated area world, including it’s breadbasket world, it’s having waterbed wave effect negatively, particularly southern countries, african countries, particular. think figure recalibrate that, attention want china. canadians billions dollars setting military operations pacific islands. australians going bore china. so, they’re they’re concentrated right ukraine way making lot western europe [unintelligible]. germans walking slightly sideways, watch president china globe, saudi arabia, know, went contradictory situation saudi arabia, real politic, contradictions figure value versus positive roles china self-determination sovereignty independence latin america largest, second largest trading partner, flexibility they’re dealing african countries building infrastructure, contrast exploitive ways u.s. moving. rise caribbean mia motley, [unintelligible] barbados taking bretton woods institutions again, taking historical mantle fidel castro talking debt, know, decades anybody started, talking climate well, fidel castro was. contradiction overly concentrated now, powerful western neoliberal capitalist forces going rabbit hole ukraine. think getting say,“whoa, wait minute, going deal china, alliance china india indonesia countries silk road, south-south relation revitalization bric countries brazil, russia, india, china.” so, think contradiction facing they’re trying leverage … zelensky he’s got come negotiating table. means line they’re going land. right wrong? don’t think it’s argument considered living room, terms real power relationships, it’s going add up. it’s going simple either-or situation. crimea going table, think, vantage point russians, donetsk area russian speaking populations are, going able execute form autonomy, context ukrainian state, appended russia. that’s think are. think that’s we’re hearing grumblings about. dealt sufficiently, public education needs more, fascist element ukraine. role element? handful people? play? internal contradictions. finally, war interests working-class people ukraine russia, ones dying battlefield political elite. don’t book putin, russian government system, recognize importance putin’s policies russia supporting cuba or, were, supporting sovereignty latin america. complexities contradictions. sort contradictions live ones absolutely suppressed defeated? sean blackmon: we’re gonna squeeze caller here, michael, tell what’s mind. caller: hi, yeah, agree say. talk eu, democracy, want clear republic. founding fathers suspicious democracies mob rule. that’s bill rights, anti-democratic protect minorities majorities. so, i’d like to, know, correction there. reason senate again, think small states suspicious large states, didn’t want ruled, specifically large states historical context. people say, well, democracy, not, intended democracy. i’m happy to, know, hear comments. sean blackmon: thanks lot calling hope hear soon. mean, gotta tell you, republic, u.s. doesn’t work either. mean, understanding republic situation power held people elected representatives, well, look how, know, congress plays out, mean, largest state country smallest states country, number representatives things like that. it’s actually representative, representatives don’t actually represent people state, they’re from. course, know, capitalism, don’t represent economic interests either. point we’re trying make, we’re necessarily talking electoral processes things like country operates, fundamentally undemocratic, unequal purpose, protect interest capitalist class, property. indeed, it’s protect capitalist system itself. needed then, real kind democracy, like we’ve discussing projects happen different parts latin america region different ways, participatory kind democracy, real representative democracy, know, this, representatives held power country, power recall sorts things, don’t actually ability do. feel like way, know, people quibble democracy, republic things like that. real relevant question is, society actually designed benefit isn’t working class here. it’s important thing consider jacquie, talk sort bourgeois democracy capitalist system, looks like, socialist structure, look like united states. mean, completely unlike country operated centuries existence, sense actually having happens communities lives, deal issues like food labor, basic things don’t control of. i’m saying moment here. jacqueline luqman: mean, exactly. to, know, caller’s point about, know, bill rights protect interests minorities. well, look people wrote bill rights, people wrote constitution, people set republic, minorities protecting not, know, landless poor people. certainly wasn’t ancestors. so, legacy minority people protecting, small number wealthy white, landowning slaveholders country, documents existed protect power. so, true, republic actually worked, idea minorities protected law, well, wouldn’t fight rights allegedly constitution. do. fighting system allows true representation, person, vote actual representative democracy allow participation people government influence government lives. is, mean, understand difference systems, think goes far, far deeper than, know, quibbling country democracy republic, is, doesn’t work, mr. early. james early: so, all, thank caller and, tonight, i’m gonna google re-examine questions. think helped bring important question table hope time i’m program look question democracy. leave convolution reading day physicists believe laws physics. mathematical models help understand things life practical things. bigger answers there. think question democracy, bourgeois democracy work way. jew, black person, homosexual, let’s say, 1920s, 1930s, lynched, spit on, burned out, pogroms, lynched, etc., argued case principles bourgeois democracy, able push law enforcement push public, stop hating stop despising you, stop lynching you, level programs jews forth on, sense people’s power principles. so, think complex matter. one, absolutes. it’s living proposition, hope revisit caller, prompted examine questions come maybe participants. look question democracy capitalism socialism. look historically evolved. socialism cuba, question democracy question pushed forward debated concrete ways. abstract principles there, practical implications easily elucidated, don’t pop automatically. so, know we’re probably run time thank caller waiting think revisit issue. sean blackmon: absolutely worthwhile topic sure. well, thank much, mr. early, joining today. freedom

spoke ramiro sebastián fúnez, honduran communist content creator based los angeles. fúnez produced film, “nicaragua empire,” premiered 15 youtube. film casts lens landscape, culture geopolitics led ongoing sandinista revolution nicaragua. interviews sandinistas, peasants, african indigenous peoples country’s autonomous zones captured march 2021 13-member delegation sanctions kill friends atc (asociación de trabajadores campa, rural peasant workers union) organized. following interview edited brevity clarity. julie varughese: thank taking time speak me. let’s start purpose delegation. ramiro sebastián fúnez: delegation called, “no sanctions nicaragua.” atc nicaragua’s oldest strongest peasant workers union played central role sandinista revolution organization facilitated land redistribution 4 million acres peasants landlords, owned somoza family dynasty. delegation organized friends atc, international solidarity organization group, sanctions kill, lot u.s.-based anti-imperialist organizations of. delegation 13 days long, able attend 10. took place march 12 march 25. jv: delegation participants asked complete project related trip. choose film? rf: film best ways educate masses, educate broad range people educational backgrounds. love writing, background writing journalism, feel nowadays people don’t time sit read article watch film documentary. that’s accessible, especially people don’t necessarily know read write. felt producing film best way approach project achieved goal maximum end teaching people exposing people successes nicaragua’s sandinista revolution. broad range people, u.s. european union, latin america, nicaraguan diaspora. highlights diversity revolutionary culture produced sandinista revolution. music big culture sandinista revolution. music talks workers’ rights, sandino fighting u.s. imperialism. music, videos art documentary form best way incorporate everything. jv: kind projects participants create? rsf: people photo essays. that’s great way capture nicaraguan revolution. wrote articles. definitely think writing articles nicaragua great. person listicle like, “10 things need know.” also, organizing seeds. collection seeds books. biggest struggles right countries pillaged sanctions food sovereignty. able grow food, independent monsanto, independent multinational imperialist agricultural companies. example, india, highest farmer suicide rates world, forced growing gmo food. delegation work help collect seeds people nicaragua help continue grow native indigenous crops grown americas thousands years global elites trying eliminate that, trying sole creators genetically modified seeds. collected books spanish indigenous nicaraguan languages like miskito deliver children caribbean coast, hit hard hurricanes november 2020. jv: nicaragua u.s. national security advisor john bolton called “troika tyranny.” nicaragua hit sanctions. sanctions affect country people united states that? rsf: john bolton definitely singled nicaragua. end 2018, protests, began imposing sanctions like nica act, limiting trade like cuba venezuela. think thing sets nicaragua apart cuba venezuela nicaragua getting love. lot progressive left supported sandinista revolution ‘70s ‘80s succumbed u.s. propaganda. solidarity movement nicaragua strong, problems urgent. think best way explain impact sanctions bring micro level, bring human level. “sanction” sounds misleading specific. doesn’t effect “economic warfare” “economic blockade.” that’s reason people cuba referred u.s. embargo blockade. example, compare country nicaragua single mother recently lost job struggling find job criminal record got didn’t do. she’s accused abusing children giving food water. constantly credit card companies back, hounding sign debt trying control life. refuses accept debt, lies her. she’s feeding children, children try speak up, suppresses them. doesn’t matter they’re true. fact they’re repeated over. sanctions mean bank calls say, “we can’t business you’re hitting kids feeding kids. lawyer, we’re going accuse lawyer collaborating criminal. we’re going accuse workplace tries hire collaborating criminal.” single mother able feed kids. originally supposed nicaragua february, postponed march american airlines canceled flights sanctions. travel—same commerce. it’s strangulation. jv: that’s helpful example use. use example mother feed children. sanctions affect business people come outside? rsf: economy nicaragua change 2007. there’s stages sandinista revolution. stage 1979 1989. point, party influenced marxism-leninism liberation theology, degree. influenced marxist economics similar command economy model like soviet union cuba, little foreign investment, central planning. gains losses model. obviously, gains didn’t deal private enterprise foreign bourgeois leaders trying sabotage economy. con entirely dependent soviet union cuba. soviet union collapsed cuba went special period 1990, year nicaragua’s economy went crisis. year, election, neoliberal candidate, violeta chamorro, won presidency. implemented free-market reforms. neoliberalism worst, private companies ruled country. second stage sandinista revolution began 2007, 2006 election daniel ortega. economic model different. new government called government unity reconciliation. sandinista party ruling party, it’s consensus government work national bourgeoisie, they’re open commerce imposition labor laws. interestingly enough, led economic gains, sandinista government power watching private enterprise. mess up, government able kick out. example, visited cigar factory estelí. nicaragua biggest producers cigars now. now, cigars “cuban cigars” nicaragua factory owned cubans florida necessarily political left. they’re allowed trade country follow rules sandinista government. got tour cigar factor atc talk workers. private sector nicaragua—including foreigners—it’s control sandinista government. similar model cuba, vietnam, china venezuela. small private sector operate country long benefits nicaraguan people. jv: sanctions going stifle ability business, wonder want stay business there. rsf: that’s great point. that’s impact sanctions. sanctions intended scare companies out. sanctions intended criminalize companies business nicaragua, order strangle economy. that’s think new mode socialism includes private enterprise. use justification, saying [socialism] doesn’t work. jv: nuestra america (our america) resonate anti-imperialist movement nicaragua? rsf: nuestra america latin america unity central nicaragua. nicaragua central role movements 20th century, movements latin america. nicaragua center central america, latin america, geographically. it’s crux north south, it’s crux caribbean, it’s crux mesoamerica, includes mexico central america. close south america. nicaragua historically position potential unity latin american caribbean countries, especially narrowest points central america oceans, inter-oceanic canal constructed ease trade countries. people nicaragua working create canal counter panama canal, control u.s. imperialists. canal use latin american caribbean people. concept nuestra america, jose martí wrote essays 1890s, central nicaragua, leaders. example, liberator central america, francisco morazán 1800s, honduras fought toughest battles nicaragua costa rican nationalists, wanted divide split central american federation. morazán, similar simón bolívar south america, wanted unite latin america federation latin american republics understood united states rising imperial power, way defend lands tyranny unite countries united states latin america. early 1900s, augusto césar sendino, earliest members central american communist party, first, not, second communist party latin america, sought unite latin america communist movement soviet union growing. sendino worked martí el salvador build like soviet union latin america. upheld idea nuestra america, upheld martí, morazán people, envisioned united latin america. later on, sandinistas able win 1979, sought expand revolution region. there’s time magazine article 1980, president daniel ortega. says, “reagan sees red.” didn’t want claim victory nicaragua sandinista front. wanted expand socialism central america. late ‘70s early ‘80s, el salvador middle guerrilla warfare, farabundo martí national liberation (flmn) close winning entire country. sandinistas arming, training supporting them, eventually revive idea united central america socialism. years, nuestra america central nicaragua argue nicaragua strongest proponents. jv: united states, african indigenous peoples colonized internally. saw nicaragua autonomous zones there, think work settler-colonial state like united states? rsf: that’s great question. inspiring things able nicaragua able talk about, provide autonomy black indigenous people coastal areas. hear liberals hipsters united states talk autonomy free liberated spaces. liberals hipsters talk nicaragua, it’s dictatorship betrayed socialism. they’re revisionists, capitalists tyrannical. right nicaragua, biggest departments autonomous. autonomous regions 50 percent country. there’s actually land black indigenous mestizo population. they’re building autonomy right now. serves model countries, latin america, world, nations nations. interesting things comparing nicaragua united states “prison house nations,” vladimir lenin described russian empire later soviet union. united states imperialist country that, root, based pillaging, colonialism, racism, banking, white supremacy. identity united states away with. nicaraguan nationalism core anti-imperialist, it’s vastly smaller poorer country. it’s vastly different u.s. nationalism. think modelling u.s., based what’s happening nicaragua, restructuring u.s. society, nationalism flag replaced. autonomous regions created africans indigenous people, hawaii puerto rico. flew autonomous areas, needed special visas traveling area. easy sandinista representatives. local tribes local communities. levels government. aspects learned like private companies government pay tax miskito people, garifuna people, afro-indigenous communities. government control land. local people lease space. thing tourism: foreign companies caribbean coast, lot tourism beaches, pay tax indigenous groups, point decide companies need leave. jv: people interested making films share information alternatives system inside united states u.s. empire? rsf: it’s story tell people you’re speaking with. went canon camera i’ve years cost $200, simple audio recorder. that, able speak lot people. looking film, certain shots look at, say, “i better. better.” scriptwriter, camera person. me. everybody that. live time that. shots, recorded iphone. it’s technology equipment. important thing making right connections. didn’t connections atc, wouldn’t able sandinista guerrillas country armed struggle. that’s it’s important involved organizations, you’re amateur [filmmaker]. that’s mainstream media gets stories wrong, it’s like random dudes europe dropping protest, flight managua. it’s illusion, protest think, “okay, good.” og, elder, somebody seen country like socialism, neoliberal period, you’re going understand context. level humility open-mindedness. right people going right story. you’re able meet right connections, that’s best way produce like able different country constantly bombarded mainstream media. international #freealexsaab solidarity
