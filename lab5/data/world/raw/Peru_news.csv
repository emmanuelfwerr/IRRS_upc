"peru coup, argentina arrest attacks “pink tide” highlight ... - freedom","editor’s note: interview originally heard radio sputnik’s afternoon program, “by means necessary.” speakers james early, sean blackmon, jacqueline luqman (toward freedom board member) sean blackmon: we’re happy joined hour today mr. james early, director cultural heritage policy center folklife cultural heritage smithsonian institution board member institute policy studies. mr. early, thanks joining us. james early: it’s good again. sean blackmon: absolutely. mr. early. we’ve seeing mass protests happening inside peru following detention president pedro castillo, sort pointing kind legislative coup carried country’s right wing. castillo’s vice president, dina boluarte, currently serving new president sort interim president, will. i’m sort wondering you’re making point. mr. early, mean, know, show, we’ve sort following castillo’s presidency candidacy period moment. moment got elected, sort issues facing administration. like it’s maybe leading point. we’re seeing inside peru moment? think says what’s happening inside country? james early: well, we’ve seen kind parliamentary maneuvers think. fundamentally, says deep, deep class divide peru, recognizing pedro castillo won popular vote 40,000 44,000 votes right-wing psycho fujimori, father right winger can’t recall he’s prison. deep class divides. we… says bourgeois democratic elections, which, withstanding fact pedro castillo received majority votes voted in, unable set apparatus deliver kinds policies promised. faced tremendous racism classism, fact rural community… traditional racist barrage them. bigger question is, election individual overturned parliamentary coup? saw [former brazilian president] dilma rousseff brazil. [brazilian president-elect luiz inácio da silva] lula’s second term, followed him. saw paraguay decades ago, decade ago now. saw attempt united states america, months ago, january, year ago. there’s deeper questions got analyze it’s bring individual power. kind cabinet brought? reflective direction vote president? reflection provincial elements country, where, case soon brazil, inauguration lula coming january 2023, hold majority parliament. cross-class alliance got set up. ratings pedro castillo low, those… ratings congress lower. so, crisis democratic system itself. away it? away voters vote particularly class, promising speak welfare majority marginalized oppressed citizens, particularly indigenous citizens case peru, we’ve got standing organized citizens’ movement 24/7 reinforces people’s power, happens government structures. so, general kinds propositions. i’m trying to… trying read learn particular case peru, we’ve seen similar events arenas think anticipate bourgeois corporate class-oriented try overturn popular vote popular parliamentary procedures. jacqueline luqman: know, mr. early, think find curious situation peru left-wing parties abandoned castillo also, decreed temporary dissolution congress, kind thing prompted this, called fresh parliamentarian elections months, installed emergency government rule country legislative powers renewed. called reorganization judiciary, public ministry, know, suppose, right wing elements within, things, guess, recognize right wing problem able govern them, i’m sure that’s right way handle that. think i’m recognizing tried things way did. left-wing free peru party, sponsored presidential candidacy, rejected actions basically abandoned him. so, i’m sure that. i’m wondering think particular aspect issue. james early: well, thoughts reflections purely speculative here, i’ve time sufficient investigation solid working thesis this. appear pedro castillo focused individual got isolated individual, having roots cabinet party reinforce policies bridge directly organized working-class people voted steward ship governance. so, stepped standard parliamentary procedures collapsed congress, sort of, intensified, isolated individual. having said that, having said speculative way, still, focus individual… problems progressive left movement tendency focus individual state structure apparatus individual of. individuals change themselves. need governance structure fall place it’s clear pedro castillo left party not… sufficient influence, rally soon enough. didn’t come thin air, percolating months relationship left parties pedro castillo outstanding questions think examine. sean blackmon: definitely. know, you’re right, mr. early, talk we’ve seen sort thing before, definitely latin america, feel like we’ve seen play brazil, bolivia. feel like we’re seeing play argentina, vice president president cristina fernandez de kirchner recently sentenced years prison disqualified holding public office life, charges corruption, fraud. so, mean, feels like similar situation based understanding terms basically right wing country, elements country going progressive leader. know, i’m definitely curious mr. early, you’re seeing argentina situation well, particularly context, know peru, backdrop consider resurgent pink tide progressive left leaning governments latin america region. james early: well, case argentina, years ago, actually, trying meet christina de kirchner, come cuba, daughter attended illness. leaving, later on… unable actually sit her. case argentina, case peru things context powerful metaphor, pink tide, obscuring metaphor time, alliances government president argentina share ideological grounding cristina husband, mean, husband, president, consolidated progressive governance, consolidated left balance government, case, let’s say, cuba. course, that’s single party state, ways, case peru. mean, case venezuela, multiple parties, lot coherency structures governance terms presidency, terms elected officials provinces, parliamentary system, military. examine metaphor pink tide, important is, struggle neoliberalism trying achieve democracy context capitalist system, trying achieve democracy material development system, looking defeat overthrow system plant pole socialism. pink tide broad alliance ideological policies brutal aspects neoliberalism. don’t share ultimate goals ultimate immediate possibility uprooting neoliberalism, case [colombian president gustavo] petro, recently elected afro-colombian vice president francia marquez. petro stated u.s. aware of. francia marquez, running vice presidency, came united states met state department. lula da silva, inaugurated week january 2023, come washington sit [u.s. president joe] biden. that’s come bow biden. suggest pink tide interim step crudest aspects neoliberal capitalism, instances, building bridges radical socialist transformation. significance pink tide spread ideologies political policies, domestic, regional international, lot alliance mutual benefits, community latin american caribbean nations. africa. small, neoliberal capitalist countries, line inter capitalist rivalry western europe united states maintaining relations them, looking regional integration, cuba major participant, nicaragua, venezuela. complexities unravel analysis political education public engagement people voting don’t … they’re deceived pedro castillo going total opposite [former peruvian president alberto] fujimori capitalist system, lula declared democratic socialist going total opposite capital country like brazil, eighth largest economy world so, build broad alliance, including middle classes corporate interests, stood [outgoing brazilian president jair] bolsonaro, bolsonaro, like [former u.s. president] donald trump, unpredictable, intent steward governance, actually stable projected plan. so, complexities terms individuals, boils correlation forces brings particular stewardship personality state governance? sean blackmon: yeah, mr. early, i’m curious standpoint analysis, mentioned passing the, know, phrase concept pink tide, it’s term obscure certain dynamics well. hoping that, too. james early: well, pink tide juxtaposed notion red tide. red tide socialist, slash communist ideological outlook immediate intent transformation owns modes production, socialize important life-defining elements like food shelter, education, health, sure people access that, limiting private enterprise. instances, people tried abandon it. instances, we’ve seen vietnam, we’re seeing, cuba adjust, limited space private initiative gorge public, takes away public well-being. pink tide sort interim, social, democratic policies. formal ideological point democratic socialists. case cuba, context pink tide latin america socialist society, socialist governance system, party etc., mix. careful looking [enmity?], equal, they’re same. there’s lot different interplay. raise larger level notion multipolarity, pink tide south-south relations plays part, tendency kind bipolarism, say, juxtapose pink tide capitalism rigid form. failed explain… president china saudi arabia, bloody dictator, little family clan controls oil. explain contradiction? think it’s explainable, means it’s complex world, correlation forces neatly aligned, simply b. there’s little strings attachment there. daily calibration set main paths, live contradictions. so, pink tide important development representing democratic…social democratic policies, welfare state, trying uplift poor marginalized. far often, think type governments rooted organized social movements, staying agile, engaged waiting delivery state, actually holding state accountable, accountable, participating policymaking implementation policies. increasing notion people’s power abstract romantic principle, day-to-day practical movement, trade unions running factories community. people involved security public safety police. involved military, professional force, citizen force. complexities observed context significance pink tide, sure don’t value struggle vulgar, deadly aspects neoliberal capitalism one, nato powers western europe, expanding latin america caribbean, continent africa, course, behemoth united states bipartisan backing military backing; bipartisanship seldom questioned struggle things u.s. bipartisan system, democrats republicans, we’ve seen, passed huge military budget adding 45 billion dollars requested. so, these, again, complexities think got able talk about, engage everyday citizens active making kinds analysis able negotiate contradictions emerge. sean blackmon: definitely. we’re gonna break hour note “by means necessary” radio sputnik washington, d.c. we’ll right back. stay means necessary. jacquie luqman continue joined mr. james early. know, mr. early, thinking break, because, know, appreciate know, you’re keen remind know, democracy collective process sustained collective process shouldn’t fall trap celebrity rising individual leaders. thinking u.s. context, particularly issue moore v. harper. case continues relevant u.s., continue hold that, know, far right attempt basically people’s fundamental democratic rights case, basically, issue person, vote itself, seemingly stake, extent, lot response fight democrats liberal wing ruling class. we’re looking situation where, know, far right gets way, threat basically like permanent, like right wing government united states, different bodies ability kind power vote place. i’m wondering sort conceive kind democratic project place like united states, fundamentally undemocratic nature, root know, time, that, know, beginning, purposeful effort ensure that, know, real participatory democracy governed united states, instead, basically whims wealthy minority, rule. know, this, somewhat speculative, it’s certainly moment we’re right now. kinds principles useful relevant begin think seriously new kind society, new system west. james early: think start concluded, open broad consistent public debate, again, public education discourse fact democracy exist describes officially united states. person vote calculus delivers stewardship local, state federal level. electoral college, fundamentally racist, historical contemporary tool. dominant duopoly two-party system republicans democrats. they’re special electorate individuals’ status inhabit governance structure, votes outweigh popular will. resulting paralyzed, dysfunctional federal system particular, fights basketball football game team win. question policies win, right wing so-called … liberals, holding status quo. joe biden clear “return normal order.” turn [msnbc host] joe scarborough, msnbc, cnn, nbc, abc stations, see, traditional liberal democratic pundit sitting moderate… called moderate republicans left party thrown party, band try reestablish duopoly dominance parties compete stewardship government, perennially local, state federal level. effect, dictatorship duopoly, it’s like party wings, will, fight oust democratic… social democratic policymakers certainly fight valid democratic socialist. so, case republican move, right establish effect record one-party governance mechanism regard, formally, popular will. right now, democrats argue can’t republicans stand way. republicans basic line let’s rid democrats, they’re socialists communists. so, tragedy comedy goes on. popular will, thought it’s it’s recognized, life circumstances continue deteriorate. resurgence covid, and, course, know reveal again, vulnerable people black brown women, working class, lgbtq, running class race line, lgbt category, trade union line going… running race gender, horizontal profile trade unions, thing. question democracy, discourse goes “we protect u.s. democratic system.” important protect rights freedom facilitation people express will, let deceive continue deceive responded content democracy. is, policy issues peoplecan work improve lives protect lives, reach legitimate dream? that’s content democracy question discussed. discussed we’re diverted pro forma situation we’re protecting ultimately precious, ultimately precious sense deliver historically marginalized, oppressed exploited people, including class sectors white community, reasons delusion skin color, socialized, outright hatred, biologically inbred, socialized educated, mis educated we’re seeing what’s going school systems turned away obvious underpinnings history uphold structure continues immiserate amphetamine addictions running country, sign people un-rooted, people lives unstable. so, question nature democracy addition fighting new maneuver republicans, let democrats stalwart protection philosophical abstraction continued paralyzed practical elements delivering. can’t… look situation california… [former u.s. representative california’s 37th district los angeles mayor] karen bass declaring state emergency… los angeles recently. unbelievable. walk downtown areas los angeles, sort human infestation will, people living sidewalk camps, know, block block block. got monumental state buildings, glowing towers so-called development. contrast right there. democracy, public policies delivered. so, think approach this, holding democrats accountable. stalwarts protect republican surge, organized citizens demanding democracy delivered content. let stop point: petition democratic party; organized citizens, identifying, maturing, nurturing, voting stewards governance accountable them, hold accountable. right now, professional politicians, we, people, demos, ordinary people [unintelligible] power ordinary people sidelined voting going boxing match something. jacqueline luqman: know, mr. early, people respond said about, know, needing hold democrats accountable don’t legislatively? people telling, vote save evil republicans? people respond saying, “well, look, people like [u.s. representative georgia’s 14th district] marjorie taylor greene congress, saying things like, organized january 6, won,” meaning, know, trump errs won, gotten wanted. point to, know, republican extremists, extremists gop, trump errs gop, that’s gop now, proof problem democrats, need focus democrats, need guys. james early: here’s issue. we’re talking question power. politics, mean, power, power improve one’s lives, protect slice, envision new possibilities, allot public resources, projects collaboration everyday citizens that. parties deliver us, tactical difference, raised level strategy common upholding system, there, spaces recognize. is, certain policies people able push citizens able push for, way comes it’s propagated individual congresswoman, congressperson it, organized citizens use example democratic socialists recently, [u.s. senator representing vermont twice ran u.s. president] bernie sanders. bernie sanders build movement, intersected organized movements. nurses, trade unions, there. we’ve seen new developments, like working families party like, existing organized citizens movements fighting sectoral areas, areas women’s rights, lgbt rights, anti-racism, right health rights. draw horizontal line, node node, network network build integrated force, reflected new party. initially, it’s reflected citizens looking right left saying, “yes, share objectives, i’m focused particular sector.” identify people vote stewards governance, 340 odd million people divided half, look half voters voting right wing stuff reasons, half relatively progressive arenas. run country individuals, need apparatus, state apparatus, need capable stewards governance that. so, folks fight, describe fight. yes, democratic party ally. battle republican party, find spaces governance structure, force agenda things help improve lives strengthen ability point, “trump,” will, transition duopoly parties set interests masses ordinary citizens. sean blackmon: definitely, definitely. know, sort sticking idea building radical popular democracy, participatory democracy, we’ve seen built… develop world, specifically parts latin america different ways. recently venezuela marked, it’s day loyalty love [former venezuelan president] hugo chavez. course, chavez was, know, beloved admired leader, stress collective nature democracy specific context venezuela’s bolivarian revolution, emphasized importance communes. i’m wondering sort playing venezuelan context? situate like hugo chavez, individual existed way efforts support masses countrymen? james early: well, have, recent occasions program, programs done, steered people emphasizing importance social movements, social organization, trade unions sector, specific groups, uniting another. don’t want dismiss role individual role individual history certainly current circumstances, different instances important. role individual runs spectrum far right left, mussolini hitler extraordinarily powerful, compelling individuals public space convince people horrendous things we’ve seen human history, holocaust issues, others. case [former south african president nelson] mandela confused case [former cuban president] fidel castro. see… [former indian prime minister] indira gandhi… again, role strong individuals relationship organize movements. therein, setting people power, governance kinds situations communes others. think it’s important principle, here’s problem we’re wanting do: level scale. government resources, government expertise build level scale. objective contradictions faced, including hugo chavez face. venezuela sits largest oil resources far know world. hugo chavez, extraordinary things building regional institutions like [union south american nations] unasur, community latin american caribbean nations, production massive numbers doctors fidel castro sent latin american medical school (elam) [santiago de] los banos outside havana cuba oil! evidence oil sold $100 barrel more, little evidence surplus putting large scale solar. so, find tethered extractive industries. case [former bolivian president] evo morales, and… help bolivia, bolivia, countries, here’s native american president socialist, socialist party, governance structure survive … individual survive coup, inherit state. immediate contradictions ran progressive indigenous population maintaining extractive industries. difficult questions, they’re easily ideologically say, “let’s mode production else.” practical arena, complex difficult. so, i’ve heard lot know, local development foodstuff, communities, providing wholesome food detroit oakland areas. important developments signal future go. able collective resources generally reside local, state federal state budget. levels scale involve many, people. case venezuela. now, there’s big interesting think important debate goes communist party venezuela relationship [venezuelan president nicolas] maduro socialist party, set late president hugo chavez, arguing issues workers treated, commands developed. yes, direction, level scale people’s power institutionalized it’s aspect ideological, romantic kind view implementation. sean blackmon: definitely we’re gonna quick break note “by means necessary” radio sputnik, washington, d.c., we’ll right back, stay us. sean blackmon: mr. early. looking reports conversations ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy having different governments, namely, united states president joe biden, emmanuel macron france recep erdoğan turkey, course. now, they’ve been, know, contact before, reportedly, latest slew conversations taken place single day. quoted saying “we constantly working partners…” added expects “important results coming week” number events do, course, ongoing war ukraine. now, it’s clear means, substance meetings were. but, mean, we’ve reached point ukraine conflict things continue escalate. time goes on, dangerous situation countries involved, world. mean, i’m sure people remember couple weeks ago missiles struck poland killing people. asserted platforms mainstream media zelenskyy himself, were, fact, russian missiles, ukrainian government officials joe biden basically pointed wasn’t clear origins missiles yet. i’m i’m wondering you’re considering conflict point, don’t think overstated, dangerous potential open conflict nuclear powers united states russia. mean, it’s somewhat relief, know people biden administration advocating negotiations. ultimately happen, think, remains seen, wondering you’re considering it? james early: well, think witnessing western europe united states australia japan, lot marbles table ukraine, argue vantage point wouldn’t fight argue stalemate, want argue ukraine winning. let’s assume sake argument ukraine winning, cost? totally destroyed country balkanized russian-speaking populations, way impose governance populations recognize element national minority rights, countries aligned politically[?], believes referendum tied russia, crimea. things we’re beginning hear people west say, well, there’s going negotiated settlement bring closer nuclear conflict. time playing game chicken poland, example, sitting right russian border, military, u.s. military bases going there’s game chicken played. there’s bigger circle political global engagement that’s going want attention dating formally…now obama administration, turning eyes pacific, means china. they’re going rabbit hole, you’re paying billions billions dollars exhausting military hardware, united states western europe, putting ukraine, seeing winter come seeing fluctuation oil prices, don’t know what’s going happen cap russian oil. watching debate, price oil dropped. lot machinations table. they’ve concentrated area world, including it’s breadbasket world, it’s having waterbed wave effect negatively, particularly southern countries, african countries, particular. think figure recalibrate that, attention want china. canadians billions dollars setting military operations pacific islands. australians going bore china. so, they’re they’re concentrated right ukraine way making lot western europe [unintelligible]. germans walking slightly sideways, watch president china globe, saudi arabia, know, went contradictory situation saudi arabia, real politic, contradictions figure value versus positive roles china self-determination sovereignty independence latin america largest, second largest trading partner, flexibility they’re dealing african countries building infrastructure, contrast exploitive ways u.s. moving. rise caribbean mia motley, [unintelligible] barbados taking bretton woods institutions again, taking historical mantle fidel castro talking debt, know, decades anybody started, talking climate well, fidel castro was. contradiction overly concentrated now, powerful western neoliberal capitalist forces going rabbit hole ukraine. think getting say,“whoa, wait minute, going deal china, alliance china india indonesia countries silk road, south-south relation revitalization bric countries brazil, russia, india, china.” so, think contradiction facing they’re trying leverage … zelensky he’s got come negotiating table. means line they’re going land. right wrong? don’t think it’s argument considered living room, terms real power relationships, it’s going add up. it’s going simple either-or situation. crimea going table, think, vantage point russians, donetsk area russian speaking populations are, going able execute form autonomy, context ukrainian state, appended russia. that’s think are. think that’s we’re hearing grumblings about. dealt sufficiently, public education needs more, fascist element ukraine. role element? handful people? play? internal contradictions. finally, war interests working-class people ukraine russia, ones dying battlefield political elite. don’t book putin, russian government system, recognize importance putin’s policies russia supporting cuba or, were, supporting sovereignty latin america. complexities contradictions. sort contradictions live ones absolutely suppressed defeated? sean blackmon: we’re gonna squeeze caller here, michael, tell what’s mind. caller: hi, yeah, agree say. talk eu, democracy, want clear republic. founding fathers suspicious democracies mob rule. that’s bill rights, anti-democratic protect minorities majorities. so, i’d like to, know, correction there. reason senate again, think small states suspicious large states, didn’t want ruled, specifically large states historical context. people say, well, democracy, not, intended democracy. i’m happy to, know, hear comments. sean blackmon: thanks lot calling hope hear soon. mean, gotta tell you, republic, u.s. doesn’t work either. mean, understanding republic situation power held people elected representatives, well, look how, know, congress plays out, mean, largest state country smallest states country, number representatives things like that. it’s actually representative, representatives don’t actually represent people state, they’re from. course, know, capitalism, don’t represent economic interests either. point we’re trying make, we’re necessarily talking electoral processes things like country operates, fundamentally undemocratic, unequal purpose, protect interest capitalist class, property. indeed, it’s protect capitalist system itself. needed then, real kind democracy, like we’ve discussing projects happen different parts latin america region different ways, participatory kind democracy, real representative democracy, know, this, representatives held power country, power recall sorts things, don’t actually ability do. feel like way, know, people quibble democracy, republic things like that. real relevant question is, society actually designed benefit isn’t working class here. it’s important thing consider jacquie, talk sort bourgeois democracy capitalist system, looks like, socialist structure, look like united states. mean, completely unlike country operated centuries existence, sense actually having happens communities lives, deal issues like food labor, basic things don’t control of. i’m saying moment here. jacqueline luqman: mean, exactly. to, know, caller’s point about, know, bill rights protect interests minorities. well, look people wrote bill rights, people wrote constitution, people set republic, minorities protecting not, know, landless poor people. certainly wasn’t ancestors. so, legacy minority people protecting, small number wealthy white, landowning slaveholders country, documents existed protect power. so, true, republic actually worked, idea minorities protected law, well, wouldn’t fight rights allegedly constitution. do. fighting system allows true representation, person, vote actual representative democracy allow participation people government influence government lives. is, mean, understand difference systems, think goes far, far deeper than, know, quibbling country democracy republic, is, doesn’t work, mr. early. james early: so, all, thank caller and, tonight, i’m gonna google re-examine questions. think helped bring important question table hope time i’m program look question democracy. leave convolution reading day physicists believe laws physics. mathematical models help understand things life practical things. bigger answers there. think question democracy, bourgeois democracy work way. jew, black person, homosexual, let’s say, 1920s, 1930s, lynched, spit on, burned out, pogroms, lynched, etc., argued case principles bourgeois democracy, able push law enforcement push public, stop hating stop despising you, stop lynching you, level programs jews forth on, sense people’s power principles. so, think complex matter. one, absolutes. it’s living proposition, hope revisit caller, prompted examine questions come maybe participants. look question democracy capitalism socialism. look historically evolved. socialism cuba, question democracy question pushed forward debated concrete ways. abstract principles there, practical implications easily elucidated, don’t pop automatically. so, know we’re probably run time thank caller waiting think revisit issue. sean blackmon: absolutely worthwhile topic sure. well, thank much, mr. early, joining today. freedom

communist party, first, not, second communist party latin america, sought unite latin america communist movement soviet union growing. sendino worked martí el salvador build like soviet union latin america. upheld idea nuestra america, upheld martí, morazán people, envisioned united latin america. later on, sandinistas able win 1979, sought expand revolution region. there’s time magazine article
